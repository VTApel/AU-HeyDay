# AU-HeyDay
A script to participate in Auburn University HeyDay!

This script allows the user to participate in an Auburn Family tradition of HeyDay!

The HeyDay tradition goes back to 1947 when WWII veteran students returned to campus to continue their education 
and members of the student body and student government association created a tradition to unite the campus and to embrace 
their peers who had returned from war. The students would have a chance to wear a nametag to foster a sense of belonging on 
the Auburn Campus for everyone.

Today this tradition continues and Auburn student, faculty, and staff are encouraged to wear nametags and greet eachother on campus by name in a tradition that still bring together the Auburn Family.

By using this script the user can participate in the Auburn HeyDay tradition from anywhere just by entering their name.
